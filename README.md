Hi, I'm Bharath Raj — a data engineering enthusiast with a background in Information Science and Engineering. After a deep dive into software development, I transitioned into the world of data where I now specialize in building robust ETL pipelines, scalable data lakes, and efficient warehousing systems using Python, Azure, Databricks, and PySpark.

This portfolio showcases selected projects that demonstrate my hands-on skills, architectural thinking, and ability to work with real-world data engineering problems.

## Why Data Engineering?

Initially inclined toward software development and web technologies, I discovered a stronger alignment with data systems — particularly with designing how data flows, scales, and serves analytics. My analytical mindset, combined with programming fundamentals, made data engineering the ideal domain where I could combine logic, performance, and structure.
